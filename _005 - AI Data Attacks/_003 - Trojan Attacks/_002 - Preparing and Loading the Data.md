Now that the model architecture (`GTSRB_CNN`) is defined, we shift focus to preparing the data it will consume. This involves setting up standardized image processing steps, known as transformations, and implementing methods to load the `GTSRB` training and test datasets efficiently.

We first define image transformations using `torchvision.transforms`. These ensure images are consistently sized and formatted before being fed into the neural network. `transform_base` handles the initial steps: resizing all images to a uniform `IMG_SIZE` (48x48 pixels) and converting them from `PIL` Image format to `PyTorch` tensors with pixel values scaled to the range [0, 1].

Code: python

```python
# Base transform (Resize + ToTensor) - Applied first to all images
transform_base = transforms.Compose(
    [
        transforms.Resize((IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE)),  # Resize to standard size
        transforms.ToTensor(),  # Converts PIL Image [0, 255] to Tensor [0, 1]
    ]
)
```

For training images, additional steps are `applied after the base transform` (and potentially after trigger insertion later). `transform_train_post` includes data augmentation techniques like random rotations and color adjustments (`ColorJitter`). Augmentation artificially expands the dataset by creating modified versions of images, which helps the model generalize better and avoid overfitting. Finally, it normalizes the tensor values using the mean (`IMG_MEAN`) and standard deviation (`IMG_STD`) derived from the `ImageNet` dataset, a common practice. Normalization, calculated as Xnorm=(Xtensor−μ)/σ, standardizes the input data distribution, which can improve training stability and speed.

Code: python

```python
# Post-trigger transform for training data (augmentation + normalization) - Applied last in training
transform_train_post = transforms.Compose(
    [
        transforms.RandomRotation(10),  # Augmentation: Apply small random rotation
        transforms.ColorJitter(
            brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2
        ),  # Augmentation: Adjust color slightly
        transforms.Normalize(IMG_MEAN, IMG_STD),  # Normalize using ImageNet stats
    ]
)
```

For the test dataset, used purely for evaluating the model's performance, we apply only the necessary steps without augmentation. `transform_test` combines the resizing, tensor conversion, and normalization. We omit augmentation here because we want to evaluate the model on unmodified test images that represent real-world scenarios.

Code: python

```python
# Transform for clean test data (Resize, ToTensor, Normalize) - Used for evaluation
transform_test = transforms.Compose(
    [
        transforms.Resize((IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE)),  # Resize
        transforms.ToTensor(),  # Convert to tensor
        transforms.Normalize(IMG_MEAN, IMG_STD),  # Normalize
    ]
)
```

We also define an `inverse_normalize` transform. This is purely for visualization purposes, allowing us to convert normalized image tensors back into a format suitable for display (e.g., using `matplotlib`) by reversing the normalization process.

Code: python

```python
# Inverse transform for visualization (reverses normalization)
inverse_normalize = transforms.Normalize(
    mean=[-m / s for m, s in zip(IMG_MEAN, IMG_STD)], std=[1 / s for s in IMG_STD]
)
```

With the transformations defined, we proceed to load the datasets. The `GTSRB` training images are conveniently organized into subdirectories, one for each traffic sign class. We can leverage `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` for this. First, we create a reference instance `trainset_clean_ref` just to extract the mapping between folder names (like `00000`) and their corresponding class indices (0,1,2,...). Then, we create the actual dataset `trainset_clean_transformed` used for training, applying the sequence of `transform_base` followed by `transform_train_post`.

Code: python

```python
try:
    # Load reference training set using ImageFolder to get class-to-index mapping
    # This instance won't be used for training directly, only for metadata.
    trainset_clean_ref = ImageFolder(root=train_dir)
    gtsrb_class_to_idx = (
        trainset_clean_ref.class_to_idx
    )  # Example: {'00000': 0, '00001': 1, ...} - maps folder names to class indices

    # Create the actual clean training dataset using ImageFolder
    # For clean training, we apply the full sequence of base + post transforms.
    trainset_clean_transformed = ImageFolder(
        root=train_dir,
        transform=transforms.Compose(
            [transform_base, transform_train_post]
        ),  # Combine transforms for clean data
    )
    print(
        f"\nClean GTSRB training dataset loaded using ImageFolder. Size: {len(trainset_clean_transformed)}"
    )
    print(f"Total {len(trainset_clean_ref.classes)} classes found by ImageFolder.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading GTSRB training data from {train_dir}: {e}")
    print(
        "Please ensure the directory structure is correct for ImageFolder (e.g., GTSRB/Final_Training/Images/00000/*.ppm)."
    )
    raise e
```

To efficiently feed data to the model during training, we wrap the dataset in a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. `trainloader_clean` handles creating batches of data (here, size 256), and shuffling the data order at the beginning of each epoch to improve training dynamics.

Code: python

```python
# Create the DataLoader for clean training data
trainloader_clean = DataLoader(
    trainset_clean_transformed,
    batch_size=256,  # Larger batch size for potentially faster clean training
    shuffle=True,  # Shuffle training data each epoch
    num_workers=0,  # Set based on system capabilities (0 for simplicity/compatibility)
    pin_memory=True,  # Speeds up CPU->GPU transfer if using CUDA
)
```

Loading the test data requires a different approach because the image filenames and their corresponding class labels are provided in a separate CSV file (`GT-final_test.csv`), not implicitly through folder structure. Therefore, we define a custom dataset class `GTSRBTestset` that inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. Its `__init__` method reads the CSV file using `pandas`, storing the filenames and labels. The `__len__` method returns the total number of test samples, and the all important `__getitem__` method takes an index, finds the corresponding image filename and label from the CSV data, loads the image file using `PIL`, converts it to `RGB`, and applies the specified transformations (`transform_test`). It also includes error handling to gracefully manage cases where an image file might be missing or corrupted, returning a dummy tensor and an invalid label (-1) in such scenarios.

Code: python

```python
class GTSRBTestset(Dataset):
    """Custom Dataset for GTSRB test set using annotations from a CSV file."""

    def __init__(self, csv_file, img_dir, transform=None):
        """

        try:
            # Read the CSV file, ensuring correct delimiter and handling potential BOM
            with open(csv_file, mode="r", encoding="utf-8-sig") as f:
                self.img_labels = pd.read_csv(f, delimiter=";")

            raise
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading or parsing GTSRB test CSV '{csv_file}': {e}")
            raise

        )

    def __len__(self):
        """Returns the total number of samples in the test set."""
        return len(self.img_labels)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):

        if torch.is_tensor(idx):

            print(f"Warning: Image file not found: {img_path} (Index {idx}). Skipping.")

                return torch.zeros(3, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE), -1

        return image, label

```

Now we instantiate the clean test dataset using our custom `GTSRBTestset` class, providing the paths to the test CSV file and the directory containing the test images, along with the previously defined `transform_test`.

Code: python

```python
# Load Clean Test Data using the custom Dataset
try:
    testset_clean = GTSRBTestset(
        csv_file=test_csv_path,
        img_dir=test_img_dir,
        transform=transform_test,  # Apply test transforms
    )
    print(f"Clean GTSRB test dataset loaded. Size: {len(testset_clean)}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error creating GTSRB test dataset: {e}")
    raise e
```

Finally, we create the `DataLoader` for the clean test set, `testloader_clean`. Similar to the training loader, it handles batching, however, for evaluation, shuffling (`shuffle=False`) is unnecessary and generally pretty undesired, as we want consistent evaluation results. Any samples that failed to load in `GTSRBTestset` (returning label -1) will need to be filtered out during the evaluation loop itself.

Code: python

```python
# Create the DataLoader for the clean test dataset
# The DataLoader will now receive samples from GTSRBTestset.__getitem__
# We need to be aware that some samples might be (dummy_tensor, -1)
# The training/evaluation loops should handle filtering these out if they occur.
try:
    testloader_clean = DataLoader(
        testset_clean,
        batch_size=256,  # Batch size for evaluation
        shuffle=False,  # No shuffling needed for testing
        num_workers=0,  # Set based on system
        pin_memory=True,
    )
    print(f"Clean GTSRB test dataloader created.")
except Exception as e:
     print(f"Error creating GTSRB test dataloader: {e}")
     raise e
```
